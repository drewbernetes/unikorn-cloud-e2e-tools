# Unikorn Cloud E2E Tools

This image pulls in [unikornctl](https://github.com/drewbernetes/unikornctl)
and [dogkat](https://github.com/drewbernetes/dogkat)
and wraps a bash script around it to enable to automation of creating a cluster, scanning it and then
deleting it.

This is useful for testing new releases of Unikorn Cloud or new images being built
by [baski](https://github.com/drewbernetes/baski) that would be used by Unikorn Cloud
